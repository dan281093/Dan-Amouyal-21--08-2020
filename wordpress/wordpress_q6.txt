WordPress actions are specifically made for themes.


Actions can be executed at any point throughout the WordPress page lifecycle.
You can only use predefined WordPress actions.


The function add_action() is used to hook a function to an action.


Actions with lower priorities are executed earlier than those with higher priorities.
